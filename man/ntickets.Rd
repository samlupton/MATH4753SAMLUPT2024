\title{The N Tickets Function}
\usage{
ntickets(N, gamma, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. The capacity of the event (the maximum number of people that can attend).}

\item{gamma}{Numeric. The risk tolerance level, representing the maximum acceptable probability of exceeding the capacity `N`.}

\item{p}{Numeric. The probability that a single person who bought a ticket will actually attend the event.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
  \item{nd}{Optimal number of tickets to sell using the discrete binomial distribution approximation.}
  \item{nc}{Optimal number of tickets to sell using the normal approximation.}
  \item{N}{The event capacity, as provided in the input.}
  \item{gamma}{The risk tolerance, as provided in the input.}
  \item{p}{The attendance probability, as provided in the input.}
}
\description{
This function estimates the optimal number of tickets to sell for an event with limited capacity `N`, based on a given
probability of no overbooking `p` and a risk tolerance `gamma`. The function calculates both a discrete and a normal approximation
to find the optimal number of tickets to sell such that the probability of exceeding capacity is controlled.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# Calculate the optimal number of tickets to sell when the event capacity is 100,
# the risk tolerance is 0.05 (5\% chance of overbooking), and the attendance probability is 0.9.
result <- ntickets(N=400,gamma = 0.02, p = 0.95)
print(result)
